# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford's released great course called ["ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) on DeepLearning.AI site.

I've followed on-screen instructions to re-create their practical Jupyter notebooks. I've then afapted the code to run against Azure OpenAI service, as it has slightly different syntax in comparison to the original OpenAI endpoint's specifics:
1. Guidelines for Prompting
2. Iterative Prompt Development
3. Summarisimng Prompt Content
4. Inferring Sentiment and Topics
5. Transforming (Language Tanslation, Spellcheck, Tone Adjustment, Format Conversion)
